## Intro / Background

### Q: What's an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) / Token Sales?

Read the free excerpt titled [ICOs: Magic Beans and Bubble Machines](https://davidgerard.co.uk/blockchain/icos-magic-beans-and-bubble-machines/) from the book [Attack of the 50 Foot Blockchain](https://davidgerard.co.uk/blockchain/book/) by David Gerard.

> Token offerings have been around a while, but kicked off enormously in the second bubble. 
> The usual pretext is crowdfunding, but in practice the tokens are just traded on the exchanges as commodities. 
> The creators then cash in. The value proposition for buyers is, as for the creators, easy money in a bubble.
>
> -- David Gerard (Attack of the 50 Foot Blockchain / ICOs: Magic Beans and Bubble Machines)

Buyer beware! If it sounds too good to be true, - surprise, surprise - it is.
Example - [Early Investors are making 50 000% returns on ICOs](https://hackernoon.com/investors-are-making-50-000-returns-on-icos-32432bc741d1) by Coin and Crypto.

> Early investment is paying off big time
>
> The average return on the S&P is 10%. Over the last year bitcoin has seen unprecedented returns of 1000%. 
> But savvy cryptocurrency investors are investing in initial coin offerings (ICOs) 
> and making return on investments (ROIs) 
> as high as 50 000%. Stop and think about that for a moment. That means for a $100 investment in early 2017
> you could have netted $50 000. Not too shabby for a year of trading.
> 
> [..]
>
> The majority of startups fail, even well funded ones,
> so be prepared to lose [all] what you invest [gamble], 
> even if the landscape is optimistic. [Too the moon!]

## Frequently Asked Questions (F.A.Q.s) and Answers


### Q: What's a Token Sale Scam?

A: If you buy these digital tokens (on the blockchain) giving free money
as a donation / gift to a company to revolutionize 
the world one block at a time than everything is ok.

If you buy these digital token (on the blockchain) trying to get rich (quick)
by selling them at a higher price to a greater fool than - surprise, surprise - 
you're getting scammed.

Let's quote the fineprint from the "Legal FAQ" from the most serious / reputable
token sale, that is, Pantos by Bitpanda:

> Pantos - in whatever form ‚Äì do NOT represent a claim on or against Bitpanda. 
> Bitpanda may decide NOT to exchange Pantos - in whatever form - at ANY time at their sole discretion. 
> [Thanks for the free money and holding the bag!] 
>
> -- Source: [Pantos Legal FAQ](https://pantos.io/pdf/pantos-ico-details.pdf)

The point is ... you own binary bits (on the blockchain) and
the value is ... excactly zero.  You say? Wait, but the token value is not (yet) excactly zero.
HODL! HODL! How much richer are you today? 

Ask yourself why should the company work hard, hard, hard to make you rich, rich, rich 
when - surprise, surprise - the company already collected all the free money from greater fools 
and  - surprise, surprise - you have zero legal claim to anything. 
Welcome to the world of business! Buyer beware! 


### Q: How can you say that these "Platform" Token Sales are Scams? Have you read the white paper? Have you seen all these serious honest businessmen, the management team and all advisors and more than dozens of happy faces in the brochure?

A: Money! Money! Money! Breaking news: Free easy money corrupts.

Breaking news: Building a "platform" to revolutionize the online betting market, tourism, token trading, ...  
you need to work, work, work hard
and - surprise, surprise - you need code monkeys (programmers).
Clicky, clicky, clicky and putting on a great dazzling marketing show is NOT good enough.

Ask these companies and happy faces where's the code, code, code?

Remember: Like secure cryptographic algorithms are by definition open - in the 21st century you can by 
definition only
build open decentralized platforms with open (source) code.

Ask these companies where are the daily check-ins, check-ins, check-ins?
Where are the daily commits, commits, commits? (‚Ä†)

Remember: Running (working) code wins.

Without open (source) code for all to see the white paper promises are just dreams or
let's name it straight - big lies and cash grab scams.
Thanks for the free money and holding the bag!

(‚Ä†): As an example / case study: The Bytes Heroes company sent in the [/ByteHeroes org(anization) with open source repos](https://github.com/ByteHeroes) -
"to proof" how hard they work on the new open decentralized platform. 
Surprise, surprise - the only open (source) code is the blockchain contracts to grab your money (and - of course - the contract code is just a run-of-the-mill copy used by all the other schemers).
Compare this to the humble [/OpenBlockchains education initiative](https://github.com/openblockchains) by a single random nobody funded by zero dollars ($0)
and written and coded in free time - See a difference?
